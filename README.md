# Machine Setup

This repository includes scripts and dotfiles used to set up a new machine to my liking. It was last updated for mac OS Catalina.

A few things that are inside:

- Dotfiles to configure specific applications like git, vim, bash
- ssh configuration
- installation of applications in `brew_setup.sh`

To run:

- `./setup.sh`
